# README Generator

## Description

Every project needs a professional README to help document information about the project, and to help users interface with the application/website/product itself.

Sometimes it can be difficult to create a new README from scratch, so I've programmed a tool that should make this process a lot easier!

Using Node.js, NPM, and Inquirer, this application lets users answer prompts via the terminal that will then be passed into the JavaScript file. From there, a new README.md file will be created with all of the information that has been input from the user.

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

Clone the repository, and make sure you have both Node.js and NPM Inquirer (v8.2.4) installed.
In Git Bash, run "node index.js"

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
